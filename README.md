# eso-light-attack-weave
This is a macro for the game Elder Scrolls Online. "Light attack weaving" is the term the ESO community uses to describe the use of a simple weapon attack right before using a spell, resulting in the animation of the weapon attack being cancelled, allowing you to do more attacks in the same amount of time.

# Usage #
1. Install the AutoHotkey interpreter ( https://autohotkey.com/ ).
2. Configure in the game the NumPad keys 1-5 as secondary keybinds for spells and NumPad 9 for the ultimate key.
3. Run the macro.
4. Enable/disable it by pressing tab.
5. \[Optional\] Press Ctrl+Tab to enable light attack weaving when pressing 5. Press again to disable. This has to be done after the macro is already active (i.e. you enabled it in accordance to step 4).

# FAQ #
Q: Is this macro considered botting?  
A: I don't think so, since it doesn't get any feedback from the game and only operates on inputs, which is not any more complex than what you could do with a gaming mouse. But I'm not working at Zenimax and can't speak for what they consider botting. So if you're unsure yourself, assume that it is.

Q: Will this macro give me an advantage over other players?  
A: No. You don't need a macro to do light attack weaving. In fact, if you do it manually, you can probably find a way to do it more efficiently (I'm not an expert, don't quote me on it). It would only give you an advantage over players who don't know how light attack weaving works, but if you're here chances are you already do.

Q: Why is 5 disabled by default?  
A: This is where I recommend to put skills you might not want to trigger light attacks, for example things you might want to cast while in stealth or in a place where you want to avoid getting into combat, like a crowded town. You can always change this behavior, if you want it to be active as soon as you run the macro (read the comments inside the macro for more info).

Q: Why is the ultimate key NumPad 9 and not 6? Do you count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9?  
A: Because I made it that way. Luckily this is open source and you can change it if OCD is plaguing you. :-)
